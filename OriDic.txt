under

before
being

nigel
was
returned

by

he
returned
the
administration
to
the
practices
of
henry
i
he
withdrew
from
much
of
his
public
work
after
around
1164
following
an
attack
of
paralysis
he
was
succeeded
as
treasurer
by
his
son
richard
fitzneal
whom
he
had
trained
in
the
operations
of
the

nigels
administrative
abilities
were

he
is
